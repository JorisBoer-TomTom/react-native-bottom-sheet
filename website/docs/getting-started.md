## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Q: How this library differ from `reanimated-bottom-sheet` or `react-native-scroll-bottom-sheet`?</summary>

  A: This library was built to provide the most native-like experience and could fit any use-case that developers wants it to be. While both libraries providing similar experience, but they still missing the following:

  - `reanimated-bottom-sheet`: Seamless gesture interaction between the sheet and the content.

  - `react-native-scroll-bottom-sheet`: Extracting scrollable content to allow developers customize the sheet content, like integrate React Navigation as the sheet content.

  Both libraries are great! and I have used both of them at my work ‚ù§Ô∏è
