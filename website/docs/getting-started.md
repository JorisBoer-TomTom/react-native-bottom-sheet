## Installation

To install the core bottom sheet, all you need to install is:

```bash
yarn add @gorhom/bottom-sheet
```

## Dependences

This library needs these dependences to be installed in your project before you can use it:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

And then you will need to link these dependences to your native projects. For iOS you need to install the pods:

```bash
cd ios && pods install
```

> ⚠️ **React Native Gesture Handler** needs extra steps to finilise its installation, please follow their [installation instructions](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler).
